//it would be nice instead of 1st letter and fourth letter if instead i had 1st letter and say official color,
// but then that runs into the problem of how do i turn a formula into a color
// hex code stuff is boring

//umm what if there was like 3rd letter and boolean is bird team

//use prime numbers, then do like if result is multiple of 3 its a bird team, multiple of 5 a cat team

// let's start with just, if it's odd the cofference starts with A, If even, then starts with n.
